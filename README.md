# Talpiot - Sprint 2: "Lost in Deep Space"

This project contains the problem definition for the following sprint.
Within this sprint, you will design and implement a motion planning algorithm that navigates in hostile area.
This file contains pre-required setup and initial instructions for the exercise.

## Setup

* You will work in `python` language.
* Your computer must have `Anaconda` and `PyCharm` installed on it. Make sure your `python` version is at least `3.7`.
* Clone this repository to an empty directory on your machine.
* In order to be able to run the code supplied, you must have several packages installed:
  * The list of required packages & versions is listed in the file `requirements.txt`
  * Open the `anaconda prompt` and enter the project directory using the command `cd <directory-path>`
  * Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Make sure all participants from your team follow the same setup before the sprint begins.

## Registration

* You are required to perform registration to the system.
* Run the `registration.py` script and perform the required instructions.

## Instructions

* Exercise formalization appears in the file `Motion Planning Sprint.docx`
* Within this file there exists:
  * Background story and problem explanation
  * Formalization of technical details about the task - how a path looks, what threats are there, etc.
  * Explanations over the existing code resources and how to use them.
* We recommend you to read the task and pre-plan your initial workflow.
